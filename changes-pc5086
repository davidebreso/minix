CHANGES:
 - adds 0xFE to the known machine IDs in readclock to support PC5086 RTC
 - replace "rep movs" with explicit loop in vid_vid_copy to fix text scrolling bug
 - add F4 hotkey to print console status dump
 - adds support for RTL8019AS network card upper memory
 - set defaults in config.h for a PC5086 small kernel
TO DO:
 - investigate more the text scrolling bug
 - find a better solution to support RTC. The current code will try (and may fail...) 
   to read the RTC any XT machine. A command line option would be a better solution.
 - start working on the ne2000 driver to support 8-bit mode
