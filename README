This repository containes the changes I made to the original Minix 2.0.2 source code
to run on the Amstrad PC5086.

CHANGES:
 - added option -i to readclock to skip machine ID check. In this way the AT-compatible
   PC5086 RTC can be read, even though the Amstrad report itself as an IBM XT.
 - removed the segment override "eseg" from "rep movs" in vid_vid_copy and changed the
   code to use the default DS register. This fix the text scrolling bug.
 - add F4 hotkey to print console status dump
 - adds support for RTL8019AS network card upper memory
 - set defaults in config.h for a PC5086 small kernel
 
TO DO:
 - modify the ne2000 driver to support 8-bit mode
 - setup networking on the PC5086
 - backport dhcpd from Minix 2.0.4
