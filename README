This repository contains the changes I made to the original Minix 2.0.2 source code
to run on the Amstrad PC5086.

CHANGES:
 - added option -i to readclock to skip machine ID check. In this way the AT-compatible
   PC5086 RTC can be read, even though the Amstrad report itself as an IBM XT.
 - removed the segment override "eseg" from "rep movs" in vid_vid_copy and changed the
   code to use the default DS register. This fix the text scrolling bug.
 - added F4 hotkey to print console status dump
 - added support for RTL8019AS network card upper memory
 - set defaults in config.h for a PC5086 small kernel
 - removed 186 instructions from real mode assembly code
 - separated drivers for NE2000 and NE1000 network cards
 - modified the NE2000 driver to support card on a 8-bit slot

TO DO:
 - test and bugfix the new NE2000 driver
 - setup and test networking on the PC5086
